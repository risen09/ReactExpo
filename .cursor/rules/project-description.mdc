General Architecture

Key principles:
1. Automation: All user interactions take place through AI.
2. Personalization: Each student gets a unique learning experience based on an analysis of their cognitive characteristics.
3. Scalability: The platform can serve millions of users simultaneously.
4. UI/UX MUST be children-friendly (ages 7-17), with less text inputs and more pre-made buttons and components

2. Client Paths (Features)

 Block 1: Getting Started
1. Registration and authorization:
- Registration via email/Google/ social media.
   - Password recovery via email.
   - Multi-factor authentication (optional).

2. Identification of the personality type:
   - Passing a test to analyze cognitive features (visual, auditory, kinesthetic).
   - Saving data in the user's profile.

3. Subject selection:
- The student chooses a subject (mathematics, physics, computer science).
   - AI offers an initial training plan.

Block 2: Training
4. Personalized Lesson Generation:
- AI creates lessons based on personality type (for example, more graphics for visuals).
   - Using LLM to generate text explanations and examples.

5. Interactive lessons:
- Step-by-step explanation of the material.
   - The ability to request additional clarification via a chatbot.

6. Practical tasks:
- AI generates tasks corresponding to the student's current level.
   - Automatic verification of responses via LLM.

7. Feedback:
   - Error analysis via AI.
   - Detailed explanation of incorrect answers.

8. Timer and Progress:
- Tracking task completion time.
   - Offering a more detailed explanation with a long lead time.

lock 3: Analytics and Progress
9. Progress analysis:
- Visualization of progress (graphs, diagrams).
   - Predicting success through LSTM.

10. Learning Recommendations:
- AI suggests topics for repetition or in-depth study.
    - Generation of a new curriculum based on progress analysis.

11. Exam preparation:
- Generation of tests according to the OGE/USE format.
    - Analyzing the student's weaknesses and proposing a training plan.

 Block 4: Interactive Elements
12. Chatbot for help:
    - AI answers students' questions in real time.
    - The ability to request an explanation of complex topics.

13. Video tutorials and animations:
    - AI generates short video tutorials and animations for visual explanation.

14. Interactive examples:
    - AI creates interactive tasks with dynamic elements (for example, dragging objects).

 Block 5: Gamification and Motivation
15. Awards and achievements:
    - A system of points for completing tasks.
    - Levels and badges (for example, "Master of Mathematics").

16. Leaderboards:
    - Student ratings within the platform.
    - A competitive element for motivation.

17. Reminder system:
- Notifications of new lessons or achievements.
    - Recommendations to continue the training.

 Block 6: Personalization and Settings
18. Profile Setup:
    - Edit name, photo, notification settings.
    - Selection of interface design themes.

19. Customization of content:
- The ability to choose the style of explanations (more detailed, brief, with examples).
    - Setting the difficulty level of tasks.

20. Integration with social networks:
- The ability to share successes on social networks.
    - Invite friends through the referral program.
